It's my modification of the Vulcaman's project :

I added buzzer, four reflow profiles with save and factory reset function.

I don't like screws on the front panel, and because of the curved top and bottom of the front panel I designed and 3D printed my own cover for a touch display, also I mounted mcu and other modules on a 3D printed holder.
